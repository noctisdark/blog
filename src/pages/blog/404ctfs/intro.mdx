## Introduction to the contest

> Co-organized by the Direction G√©n√©rale de la S√©curit√© Ext√©rieure (DGSE) and T√©l√©com SudParis, the 404 CTF is France's biggest cybersecurity competition. Following the success of the 2022 edition, which celebrated the double anniversary of the BCRA and the DGSE, this second edition will honor the great figures of French literature.
>
> For one month, take on challenges designed by T√©l√©com SudParis' HackademINT cybersecurity club. Whether you're an expert or a beginner, don't hesitate to put your skills to the test during this individual CTF!

### First challenges:

#### Bienvenue !

Looking at the challenge description:

> Maintenant, si vous souhaitez acc√©der au reste du 404 CTF, nous vous invitons √† lire la page des r√®gles. Le premier flag s'y trouve afin que vous puissiez valider la pr√©sente √©preuve et d√©bloquer les autres √©nonc√©s.

When visiting [the rules page](https://ctf.404ctf.fr/rules), we find the first flag.

> Mais nous vous donnons le premier flag ici : `404CTF{c'est parti}`.

#### Exemple de connexion distante

Again in the challenge description:

> Le pr√©sent exemple vous demande simplement de vous connecter, et le flag vous sera donn√© imm√©diatement.
>
> `nc challenges.404ctf.fr 30076`

Doing exactly that, we get the flag: `404CTF{I_<3_nc}`

#### Discord

For the flag, you have to search the discord. There are two clues: the CTF opening date and the challenge description.
We land on this post in the `announces` channel on the discord server:

### Desir√© Dubois

This one is a very interesting challenge.

 audio features an amusing conversation between two individuals planning to call "D√©sir√©e Dubois" as part of an organized scam.
Here is the audio for the challenge:

<audio controls>
  <source src="/static/media/404ctf/Desiree_Dubois.mp3" type="audio/mp3"/>
</audio>

The audio is hilarious and it's about two 2 planning to call `D√©sir√©e Dubois`, organizing a scam of sorts.

So I plugged in the audio file in `Audacity` in order to thourougly analyze it, in reality I was hoping to find a flag in the spectrogram (classical challenge) but that was to no avail.

I then re-read the statement of the challenge:

```
....
Clearly, the person on the other end of the line is the victim of a bad move. They should be warned
...
```

You can hear the scammers using a rotary dial phone to call the victim, maybe we can use the audio to call the same number they did ? Turns out that is the way to go !
I measured the time took to dial each number in `Audacity`, because it's better than relying on my reaction time. And I got this array:

```python
measurements = [
  [1.6680000000000001, 0.9100000000000001, 0.9630000000000001, 1.4049999999999994, 0.46499999999999986, 1.6489999999999991, 0.9980000000000011, 0.6159999999999997, 0.9869999999999983, 0.8930000000000007],
]
```

The count checks out, the number of digits a phone number in France is usually 10 and we do have extra information:
- Phone numbers in France usually start with a zero
- In a rotary dial, 0 is the last number, it means it takes more time to dial (which agrees with the measurements)

My idea was to fit this numbers on a line, and guess the numbers from the time taken to dial them. But in order to draw a line, we need two points and we only have one.
I might be missing information for the other point, but I solved this challenge by guessing and evaluating my guesses.

```python
err_fn = lambda x: abs(x - round(x))

def eval(pointA, pointB):
  a = (pointB[1] - pointA[1]) / (pointB[0] - pointA[0])
  b = pointA[1] - pointA[0]*a

  print(f"Found line parameters: {a=}, {b=}")

  err = 0
  result = []
  for d in measurements:
    x = (d - b)/a
    result.append(round(x))
    err += err_fn(x)
  return err, result

for i in range(1, 10):
  print(eval(
    [10, max(measurements)],
    [i, min(measurements)]
  ))
```

It appears that: `min(measurements) -> 1` is the best guess, or maybe I'm just lucky.

This yields the phone number `[10, 4, 5, 8, 1, 10, 5, 2, 5, 4] -> 0458105254`.

The receive a reply in the same theme of the audio, which announces the flag.

In the challenge format, the flag is: `404CTF{justeleflag}`
